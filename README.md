# ltk-pr-action

A shared github action for our PR's : node setup, running unit tests and linting scripts

This Dockerized action is using **Node v12**

## What it does
- Installs the dependencies as defined in your project's `package.json`
- Runs unit tests : `npm run test`
- Runs linting : `npm run lint`

## Setup
1. Your project should have a `package.json` file that contains these scripts:
- `test`
- `lint`

In case they are not present the action will NOT execute them ðŸ˜„

2. In your action make sure to configure the env variable of `PRIVATE_REPO_PAT`
- This is used for installing private packages


## Example Usage

```yaml
name: Testing and Linting
